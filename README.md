<h1 align="center">Hello, I am David. 👋</h1>
<h3 align="center">A passionate Cybersecurity professional and Cloud Security Engineer committed to protecting data and enhancing cybersecurity measures in the cloud.</h3>
 <br />

 This Github repository is meant to showcase my entire Cybersecurity journey and the projects I've done during it.

I've had the pleasure of working hard to increase my cybersecurity and cloud security engineering skills.  Most times it doesn't feel like work because I loved every moment of it, even the frustrating times when I had to troubleshoot issues in my projects.

You are invited to explore my GitHub portfolio to get a glimpse into my technical capabilities. These projects showcase insights into my problem solving approach, attention to detail, and ability to analyze risks and implement appropriate mitigation strategies.
